Requirements: MATLAB 2011 or later.

To run NetFill and Top-l-dni on two seed disconnected on a Linux/mac system:

Just run make on the current directory
(I am assuming matlab is installed on your system and the command line interpreter is invoked by "matlab -nodisplay". If not then changes have to be made in the file demo.sh)

You can also run NetFill and Top-l-dni on two seed disconnected on a windows system:
By opening matlab and running the DEMO.m in the src/ folder.

For other data sets you need to check DEMO.m on how to invoke Topldni.m (Top-l-dni in the paper) and complete.m (for NetFill).

Note: "visualize_grid.m" will work only for 60x60 grid graph(as described in the paper).

Output graphs can be seen in the output/grid-disconnected-NetFill.pdf and output/grid-disconnected-Top-l-dni.pdf

If you want to try your own graph then the input G should be an adjacency matrix. Variables S, SD, D etc. should be of size [1, length(G)] i.e. like indicator variables.
